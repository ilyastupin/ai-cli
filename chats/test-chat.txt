# ChatGPT CLI Tool

## Overview
The ChatGPT CLI Tool is a command-line interface designed for interacting with OpenAI's ChatGPT model. It allows users to engage with ChatGPT via markdown files, upload files for various uses, and list uploaded files with metadata. Additionally, it can render markdown to HTML on demand.

## Features
- **Chat Functionality**: Engage with ChatGPT using markdown files.
- **File Upload**: Upload files to OpenAI (e.g., for assistance).
- **File Listing**: View metadata of uploaded files.
- **Markdown Rendering**: Convert markdown content to HTML and open it in a browser.

## Installation
Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. Then, install project dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

This project uses the `openai` library to interface with the OpenAI API.

## Usage
Use `chatGPT.js` to interact with the CLI tool. Several options are available:

```bash
Usage:
  node chatGPT.js --chat <file.txt> [--open-md]
  node chatGPT.js --upload <file>
  node chatGPT.js --list
  
Options:
  --chat <file.txt>     Use a markdown chat file
  --open-md             Post-conversation, render markdown to HTML and open it
  --upload <file>       Upload a file to OpenAI Files API
  --list                List all uploaded files with their metadata
  --help                Display this usage message
```

### Examples
- To chat with GPT using a markdown file:
  ```bash
  node chatGPT.js --chat session1.txt
  ```
- Upload a file for assistant usage:
  ```bash
  node chatGPT.js --upload data.json
  ```
- List all uploaded files:
  ```bash
  node chatGPT.js --list
  ```
