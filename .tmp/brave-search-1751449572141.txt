Trump said Iran and Israel both "violated" the ceasefire that he announced late on Monday.Through last week, the president and his administration continued to push back on an early intelligence report suggesting that the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities may have only set Tehran's nuclear program back by months.Latest headlines:Jun 28, 2025, 11:10 AM EDTTrump doesn't believe Iran hid uranium before strikesJun 27, 2025, 7:24 PM EDTSenate votes down Iran War Powers ResolutionJun 27, 2025, 2:11 PM EDT'Worst nuclear safety scenario' was 'avoided' in Israeli-US strikes on Iran, IAEA saysJun 27, 2025, 12:48 PM EDTTrump says he would bomb Iran again 'without a question'Here's how the news is developing.Jun 29, 2025, 6:32 AM EDTTop Israeli official to travel to Washington on MondayIsraeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer -- a top adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- will arrive in Washington, D.C. on Monday for talks with President Donald Trump's administration, an Israeli official told ABC News.Dermer's visit is expected to include discussions on the war in the Gaza Strip, the recent conflict with Iran and Netanyahu's planned visit to the White House next month.-ABC News' Jordana Miller and Victoria BeauleJun 29, 2025, 4:53 AM EDT71 killed in Israeli attack on Iranian prison, official saysThe Israeli airstrike on Tehran's Evin Prison on June 23 killed 71 people, according to a spokesperson for the Iranian judiciary quoted by the semi-official Iranian ISNA News Agency.In this picture obtained from the Iranian Mizan News Agency on June 25, 2025, rescuers sift through the rubble inside in the Evin prison complex in Tehran, Iran, that was by an Israeli strike.Mostafa Roudaki/mizanonline/AFP via Getty ImagesAsghar Jahangir said Sunday that victims included "the prison's administrative staff, conscripts, prisoners, families of prisoners who were at the prison to visit or pursue their cases in court and neighbors who lived near the prison."The Israeli strike on Evin was part of a wave of attacks on what Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said were "regime targets and government bodies in the heart of Tehran."The attack on the prison prompted criticism. Nobel Peace Prize laureate and imprisoned Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi, for example, said the attack was "undoubtedly a clear example of a war crime."United Nations human rights spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said Evin "is not a military objective and targeting it constitutes a grave breach of international humanitarian law."The Israel Defense Forces claimed the strike was conducted in a "targeted manner in order to avoid harming uninvolved people," but families of prisoners have expressed serious concerns about the safety of their loved ones. Several accounts on Iranian media describe scenes in which civilians and prisoners were injured or killed.There are also reports of prisoners being moved from Evin to other prisons in Tehran, raising concerns among families and human rights activists.-ABC News' Somayeh MalekianJun 28, 2025, 11:10 AM EDTTrump doesn't believe Iran hid uranium before strikesPresident Donald Trump does not believe Iran hid its enriched uranium before the U.S. launched strikes on its nuclear facilities, he told Fox News in an interview."I don't think they did. No, first of all, it's very hard to do. It's very dangerous to do, it is very heavy, very, very heavy. It's a very hard thing to do plus we didn't give much notice because they didn't know we were coming until just then. And nobody thought we'd go after that site because everybody said that site is impenetrable," Trump said."They moved themselves, they were all trying to live, they didn't move anything," Trump said.-ABC News' Hannah DemissieJun 27, 2025, 7:24 PM EDTSenate votes down Iran War Powers ResolutionSenate Republicans did not agree to push forward a resolution on Friday that would block President Donald Trump’s ability to use additional military force against Iran without explicit authorization from Congress.By a vote of 53-47, a motion to advance Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia’s measure invoking the 1973 War Powers Resolution failed, with Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania -- a staunch supporter of Israel -- joining Republicans in opposing it.One Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, crossed party lines to support the measure, which would have needed just a simple majority of 51 votes to pass.Seven Republicans currently serving in the Senate voted for a similar Iran resolution back in 2020 -- a measure that was also championed by Kaine.Ahead of the vote on Friday, one of those Republicans -- Sen. Todd Young of Indiana – said that he "does not believe an Iran war powers resolution is necessary at this time," in the wake of a security briefing held on Thursday by top members of Trump’s cabinet.The resolution that failed on Friday would have required that any further hostilities with Iran have authorization by a declaration of war or an authorization of military force from Congress.Kaine introduced the measure a few days before the U.S. bombed three of Iran’s critical nuclear sites.On Friday during a speech on the Senate floor, Kaine said there is a prevailing need for the measure due to the shaky nature of the current ceasefire between Iran and Israel, which was announced by Trump earlier this week."I pray the ceasefire continues, but I fear we're going to be back here on this floor," he said. "And I hope when we are on this floor again, members of this body will stand for the proposition that has been part of our history -- that war is too big an issue to allow one person to make the decision that sends our sons and daughters into harm's way."-ABC News' Isabella MurrayRelated TopicsIranIsraelPresident TrumpTrump AdministrationUS MilitarySponsored Content by TaboolaTop StoriesBryan Kohberger agrees to plead guilty to all counts in Idaho college murders caseJun 30, 9:05 PMSuspect in deadly Idaho ambush previously wanted to be a firefighter: SheriffJun 30, 8:07 PMSenate begins debate on Trump's 'big, beautiful bill'Jun 29, 9:32 PMTrump admin live updates: House Rules Committee advances megabill to floor3 hours agoMeteorologists are losing vital tool for forecasting hurricanes as the season startsJun 30, 5:50 PMABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News

​President Donald Trump issued a forceful defense of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu on Wednesday, slamming the ongoing corruption trial against him as a “Witch Hunt” and calling for the charges to be dropped or a pardon granted immediately.Posting to Truth Social, Trump said he was “shocked” to learn that Netanyahu, fresh off what Trump called “one of [Israel’s] Greatest Moments in History,” is still being summoned to court.
“Bibi and I just went through HELL together, fighting a very tough and brilliant longtime enemy of Israel, Iran,” Trump wrote. “Bibi Netanyahu was a WARRIOR… [and] the result was something that nobody thought was possible, a complete elimination of potentially one of the biggest and most powerful Nuclear Weapons anywhere in the World.”The president condemned the ongoing prosecution, which dates back to 2020 and includes accusations that Netanyahu accepted luxury gifts from Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan.One now-viral detail from the trial: testimony that Netanyahu’s wife requested a giant Bugs Bunny stuffed toy for their son ahead of a 1996 dinner with Milchan.Trump called the trial a political attack over trivial matters, writing: “This long running, politically motivated case, ‘concerning cigars, a Bugs Bunny doll, and numerous other unfair charges’... is unthinkable to me.”
Trump concluded by urging Israel to act: “Bibi Netanyahu’s trial should be CANCELLED, IMMEDIATELY, or a Pardon given to a Great Hero… THIS TRAVESTY OF ‘JUSTICE’ CAN NOT BE ALLOWED!”The trial resumes Monday in Jerusalem.Posted by Jasmine Baehr ShareGingrich: America 'taught the world a lesson' in Iranian nuclear site strikes​Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich praised President Donald Trump’s leadership and strategic patience in the successful neutralization of Iran’s nuclear threat and the brokering of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.Speaking on "Hannity," Gingrich called the 12-day campaign “historic” and credited both Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with executing a long-planned and highly coordinated operation.Gingrich emphasized that while the media often portrays Trump as chaotic, his approach to the Iran crisis revealed a clear strategy. “Trump is very disciplined… He had a clear deadline. He artfully said to the world, ‘I would really like to avoid this."
He described the mission’s culmination, the U.S. bombing of Iran’s key nuclear sites, as a showcase of American power and global deterrence.“We taught the world a lesson. We can launch bombers from Missouri to anywhere in the world and have precision targets that are annihilating,” Gingrich said.Looking ahead, Gingrich warned the success of the ceasefire depends on Iranian compliance. He said the regime must end ballistic missile development, stop proxy attacks, and allow full inspections of its nuclear program.“The minimums for thinking this is successful are: quit saying ‘Death to Israel’ and ‘Death to America,’” he added.Posted by Jasmine Baehr ShareBlackburn praises Operation Midnight Hammer: 'This Is what peace through strength looks like'Senator Marsha Blackburn praised the U.S. military and President Donald Trump for the success of Operation Midnight Hammer, calling it a historic moment in American and global security.Speaking from the Senate floor, Blackburn described the mission as “absolutely incredible,” declaring that the United States “wiped out Iran’s nuclear program.”
She emphasized Iran’s long history of promoting terror and chaos across the Middle East while advancing its nuclear ambitions under chants of “death to Israel” and “death to America.”That threat, she said, is now eliminated “thanks to the bravery, valor, and unmatched capability of the U.S. Military” and President Donald Trump’s “decisive leadership.”She added, “Make no mistake, we have the only military on the planet that could get this job done,” crediting American service members as “the greatest fighting force in the history of the world.”
Blackburn concluded by stressing that a ceasefire has already been reached between Israel and a “much weaker Iran,” stating, “This is what peace through strength looks like, and only the U.S. military under President Trump’s leadership could accomplish this feat.”Posted by Jasmine Baehr Sharewindow.foxstrike.
