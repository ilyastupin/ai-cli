Here’s a more detailed view of how the process is implemented:\n\n1. **Initialization and File Preparation**:\n   - The script retrieves the list of Git-tracked files and the current commit hash.\n   - It sets up a temporary directory and ensures it exists.\n\n2. **File Writing Process**:\n   - Each text-based file’s content is read and written into a single output file, prefixed by comments indicating which file it came from.\n   - Binary files are skipped with a warning message.\n\n3. **Completion and Upload**:\n   - After writing, it closes the write stream and prepares the file for upload.\n   - The files are uploaded to the vector store, using the project name as the vector store name if no existing vector store is defined.\n\n4. **Logging**:\n   - The creation and upload actions are logged for tracking using helper functions【18:2†source】.\n\nThese operations ensure that the codebase can be effectively bundled and referenced by the vector store, aligning with the main project objective of efficient data handling and accessibility【18:1†source】."
