It provides an efficient way to store, retrieve, and manage data for AI-based assistants.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Vector Store Management**: Ability to create, manage, and delete vector stores.\n- **Assistant Creation and Management**: Create AI assistants with specified tools and instructions, update their resources, and manage existing assistants.\n- **Thread Management**: Create and delete threads to manage conversations, and track conversation history.\n- **File Management**: Upload codebases to vector stores, skip binary files, and handle text-based tracked files using Git.\n- **Logging History**: Maintain comprehensive logs of operations performed by the CLI for audit and debugging purposes【4:2†source】【4:3†source】.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo set up the project, ensure you have Node.js installed. Use pnpm for package management. You can install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:\n\n```bash\npnpm install\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo start using the CLI, execute the following command in the terminal:\n\n```bash\n./bin/ai-cli\n```\n\nThis script initializes the CLI and connects it to the necessary OpenAI services to begin operations such as creating vector stores and managing assistants【4:6†source】【4:9†source】.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you would like to contribute to the project, please follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Fork the repository.\n2. Create a new branch.\n3. Make your changes.\n4. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.\n\n## Contact Information for Support\n\nFor any questions or issues related to this project, please contact the primary maintainer through GitHub Issues or reach out to the provided email in the `package.json` file (if available)【4:4†source】.\n\n## Known Issues or Limitations\n\n- The CLI may encounter issues with unreadable or binary files which are skipped during the upload process.\n- Network dependency: Functionality is reliant on consistent network access to OpenAI services【4:8†source】【4:11†source】.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the ISC License. Please refer to the LICENSE file for more details【4:11†source】."
