# ChatGPT CLI Tool

## Overview
The ChatGPT CLI Tool is a command-line interface designed for interacting with OpenAI's ChatGPT model. It allows users to engage with ChatGPT via markdown files, upload files for various uses, and list uploaded files with metadata. Additionally, it can render markdown to HTML on demand.

## Features
- **Chat Functionality**: Engage with ChatGPT using markdown files.
- **File Upload**: Upload files to OpenAI (e.g., for assistance).
- **File Listing**: View metadata of uploaded files.
- **Markdown Rendering**: Convert markdown content to HTML and open it in a browser.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

This project uses the `openai` library to interface with the OpenAI API.
